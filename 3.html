    <P>What makes up a database? Data for sure. (What use is a database that doesn’t store anything?)
        But a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is actually much more than data. Today’s
        advanced RDBMSs not only store your data; they also manage that data for you, restricting what
        kind of data can go into the system, and also facilitating getting data out of the system. If all you
        want is to tuck the data away somewhere safe, you could use just about any data storage system.
        RDBMSs allow you to go beyond the storage of the data into the realm of defining what that data
        should look like, or the business rules of the data.</P>
    <P>
        Don’t confuse what I’m calling the “business rules of data” with the more generalized business
        rules that drive your entire system (for example, someone can’t see anything until they’ve logged
        on, or automatically adjusting the current period in an accounting system on the first of the
        month). Those types of rules can be enforced at virtually any level of the system. (These days, it’s
        usually in the middle or client tier of an n-tier system). Instead, what we’re talking about here are
        the business rules that specifically relate to the data. For example, you can’t have a sales order
        with a negative amount. With an RDBMS, we can incorporate these rules right into the integrity of
        the database itself.</P>
