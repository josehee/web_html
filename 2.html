    <P>I’ll start with my kids, who somehow continue to be just wonderful even in the face of dad stressing out
        over this and that. Even as my youngest has asked me several times when I’m “going to be done with
        that book” (she is not pleased with how it takes up some of my play time), she has been tremendously
        patient with me all during the development of this book. My eldest just continues to amaze me in her
        maturity and her sensitivity to what doing a book like this requires (and, of course, what it means to her
        college education!). The thank yous definitely need to begin with those two</P>
